## 24 March 2019

* Fix: It's now possible to test Send Email actions before creating them. Prior to this, the Test button would not do anything for the Send Email action.

## 6 March 2019

* New feature: Extract XPath Custom Action with accompanying xpath() WebhookScript function. [Read more.](/custom-actions.html#extract-xpath)

## 29 Feburary 2019

* Values are no longer required for Condition actions, so it's possible to compare an empty string or missing value.
* Fixed an issue where a tooltip in the Custom Actions modal would not disappear.
* Removed Beta label from WebhookScript.

## 27 Feburary 2019

* Fixed a bug where slashes at the end of Webhook.site Single Page App URLs didn't work.

## 26 Feburary 2019

* It's no longer a requirement to specify a variable for the Send Request action.

## 25 Feburary 2019

* New feature: It's now possible to receive emails, which are treated like Webhooks – so you can automate emails with Custom Actions on Webhook.site. You can also test email deliverability using DKIM, DMARC and SPF validation.
* JSON formatting is now always enabled per default.
* The requests view is cleared after deleting the last request, and the tutorial text is shown.

## 16 Feburary 2019

## 12 Feburary 2019

## 8 Febuary 2019

* New Custom Action type: Condition, which lets you conditionally stop a set of actions based on comparisons.

## 28 January 2019

* WebhookScript now supports newline literals (`\\n`) in strings, escaped by 2 backslashes.

## 25 January 2019

* Global Variables are now available in the Control Panel, which lets you keep configuration like API keys in a separate place from your Custom Actions and scripts while managing them at a central place.

* Changed the font of the WebhookScript editor, which resulted in uneven selection of text.

## 23 January 2019

* You can now specify a source variable for JSONPath and Regex actions, so you can extract text from not only the request content.

## 12 January 2019

* Switched to using Ace as editor for WebhookScript.
