Base URL: https://webhook.site . We recommend that you set the Accept header to application/json . About Tokens A token is a container for incoming requests and emails, and corresponds to a Webhook.site URL or Email. A token ID is a 36 character UUID consisting of hexadecimal characters and dashes. Simply, the token ID is the part after https://webhook.site/ in the URL, or before @email.webhook.site in the email address. Authentication While most functions in the API work without any authentication whatsoever, some endpoints do require authentication, or will return a 401 Unauthorized status code. API Key An API Key can be generated in the Control Panel, and provides access to Tokens that are either a) password protected or b) require login. To specify an API Key in a request, use a HTTP header: Api-Key: [your API Key] Password If you have enabled password authentication on a Webhook.site URL/Token, to access the resource, either a) use the ?password=[your password] query string b) set the password using HTTP Basic Auth.

The actions can extract data from the request and use it to send another request as well as modify the response. With this, you can connect APIs that aren't compatible, convert a request to an email, and much more. About Variables Variables are an important part of Custom Actions, and are characterized by a name surrounded by two dollar signs: $example$ . Variables can be used in any field that has a \u24e5 icon in the editor. They act as placeholders that are replaced by dynamic content as the request or email is received. Each request or email has a set of base variables that contain information like the request IP, method, headers, query string values, form values and the request content. To see a list of variables, click the Variables button in the editor. Clicking on a variable copies it to the clipboard. Almost all of the available Custom Actions can register a variable during the runtime of the actions, so for example you can register the result of a JSONPath query and use it in a \"Modify Response\" action to make the response dynamic, or even use it to send a request to another HTTP address, and then use the response of that. This works since Custom Actions are executed synchronously in a chain, sharing data as they're being executed. The format of variables are dollar signs surrounded by a word, for example: $example$ . Default request variables These variables are automatically available for each request or email. Different variables are available depending on the type. Variable Name Available For Description request.uuid All The UUID of the request request.token_id All The Token UUID (URL ID) of the request request.content All The body content of the request request.date All Creation date in Y-m-d H:m:s format request.hostname All Hostname of the request (usually webhook.site ) request.header.[name] All Created for each HTTP header request.size All Request body size in bytes request.type All Request type ( email or web ) request.query.[name] Web Created for each query string (e.g. ?name=value) request.form.[name] Web Created for each form field request.file.[name].filenamee Web Created for each file upload, with name being the input name property. Contains the client file name request.file.[name].size Web Contains the file size in bytes request.file.[name].content Web Contains the file content request.ip Web IP of the host making the request request.user_agent Web User agent header request.url Web Full URL of the request (e.g. https://webhook.site/xxx-xxx...) request.method Web HTTP method (GET, POST, etc.) request.sender Email Sender address request.message_id Email Email message ID request.text_content Email Parsed plaintext content request.destinations Email Comma separated list of recipients. request.checks.[name] Email True or false for email checks (DKIM, SPF, etc.) WebhookScript Executes custom scripts using a scripting language that's very similar to JavaScript and PHP. More information here Extract JSONPath This action runs a JSONPath query on the contents of a request. With it, you can extract any data from a JSON document and store it in a variable, which can then be used in a downstream action. JSONPath is very similar to the jq commandline utility. JSONPath Examples JSONPath Result $.store.books[*].author the authors of all books in the store $..author all authors $.store..price the price of everything in the store. $..books[2] the third book $..books[(@.length-1)] the last book in order. $..books[-1:] the last book in order. $..books[0,1] the first two books $..books[:2] the first two books $..books[::2] every second book starting from first one $..books[1:6:3] every third book starting from 1 till 6 $..books[?(@.isbn)] filter all books with isbn number $..books[?(@.price<10)] filter all books cheapier than 10 $..* all elements in the data (recursively extracted) JSONPath Syntax Symbol Description $ The root object/element (not strictly necessary) @ The current object/element . or [] Child operator .. Recursive descent * Wildcard. All child elements regardless their index. [,] Array indices as a set [start:end:step] Array slice operator borrowed from ES4/Python. ?() Filters a result set by a script expression () Uses the result of a script expression as the index For more details on what's possible with JSONPath, take a look at the docs . As you start entering a JSONPath, the results are validated and shown next to the input field. Extract Regex This action runs a Regex (regular expression) query on the contents of a request. With it, you can extract any data from a text document and store it in a variable, which can then be used in a downstream action. As you start entering a Regex, the results are validated and shown next to the input field. Extract XPath Similar to the Extract JSONPath Custom Action, Extract XPath lets you extract values from an XML or HTML document and save the result as a variable. XPath Examples The following examples are based on this XML document: <?xml version=\"1.0\"?> <organization name= \"ExampleCo\" > <employees> <employee id= \"1\" > Jack </employee> <employee id= \"2\" > Ann </employee> </employees> </organization> Example XPath | Notes | Result --------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------ /organization | Finds all content within the organization element | Jack Ann //employee[@id != 1] | // traverses all <employee> elements in document, the @id query selects all except those with id =1 | Jack /organization/@name | @name to get the \"name\" property of the element | ExampleCo /organization/employees/employee[2] | [2] specifies 2nd element | Ann /organization/employees/employee[2]/@id | Get the \"id\" property of second employee element | 2 /organization/employees/employee[@id=1] | Employee element with id property equal to \"1\" | Jack /organization/employees/employee[last()] | Last employee element | Ann //employee[contains(@id, \"2\")] | Employee within any parent element where id contains \"2\" | Ann For more examples, see W3CSchools or XPath Cheatsheet Send Request This will send a request with variable contents from the Webhook.site cloud. Per default, the request contents will be identical to what was sent to the URL originally. Variables extracted previously can be used. The response of the request is stored in a series of variable names prefixed with a value of your choosing. The following variables are set after the request has been fired: $your_prefix.content$ - response body content $your_prefix.status$ - response status code $your_prefix.headers$ - response headers $your_prefix.url$ - the URL the request was sent to Send Email This will send a email with variable contents from the Webhook.site cloud. Variables extracted previously can be used. Modify Response This action can be used to modify the response of the Webhook.site URL based on the input. Condition Useful if you need to validate that the request does or does not conform to certain criteria, the Condition action will either stop or continue based on a condition. In both the input and the value fields, variables will be replaced (including Global Variables from the Control Panel), so you can compare e.g. JSONPath or Regex values - or even values from a previous HTTP request that was sent. Currently, two actions are provided: stop and continue. Stop will stop further action execution of the condition is a match. Continue will only continue further execution if the condition is a match, and otherwise stop. The following \"operators\" are available: is equal to is not equal to starts with ends with contains does not contain is greater than is greater than or equal to is less than is less than or equal to The \"result\" of the condition will be logged below the request details, so you can see what happened. Google Sheets (Beta) Google Sheets Custom Actions lets you manipulate and retrieve values from a Google Sheet. The following Google Sheets Custom Actions are available: Add Row - appends one or more new rows to an existing spreadsheet Update Row - updates one or more cells in an existing spreadsheet Get Values - retrieves one or more cell values from an existing spreadsheet To start, you need to make sure that you have connected a Google account in the Control Panel, available here . After that, you can select the account in the dropdown when creating the Custom Action. Specifying the spreadsheet When specifying the spreadsheet, you can either just copy/paste the spreadsheet URL or enter the spreadsheet ID. Variables can be used to specify the spreadsheet. Ranges All actions must specify a range, which behaves similar in all actions. For the Add Row action, Google Sheets will automatically find a \"table\" (e.g. a homogenous mass of data) and add the values at the bottom. A range is the same query as in Google Sheets, e.g. to select A1-C3 in Worksheet \"Example\", enter 'Example'!A1:C3 . Values When inserting or updating values, you can either enter a value in the text field, or supply multiple cells and/or rows using JSON. To insert two rows, the JSON would be [\"cell 1\", \"cell 2\"] . Variables The Get Values Action allows you to define variables based on the output. Since this action can return multiple pieces of data, multiple variables are created. For example, if you select two columns and two rows, e.g. A1:B2 , four variables would be defined: variable_name.0.0 = value of A1 variable_name.0.1 = value of A2 variable_name.1.0 = value of B1 variable_name.1.1 = value of B2 Additionally, the data is available in JSON, with the variable_name.json variable being defined, and continuing with the example above, would contain the following JSON: [ [ \"A1\" , \"A2\" ], [ \"B1\" , \"B2\" ] ] Amazon Web Services (AWS) (Beta) S3 The following actions are available for AWS S3: Create Bucket Create Object Delete Object Get Object (retrieves object contents to a Variable) In addition to the \"official\" Amazon endpoints, Webhook.site also supports S3-compatible storages like DigitalOcean, MinIO, Wasabi and more. The endpoint can be specified when setting up the account in Control Panel. CloudFront The \"Create Invalidation\" action allows you to dynamically create a CloudFront cache invalidation as a Custom Action. Both the Distribution ID and the paths to be invalidated are replaced with Webhook.site Variables. Discord (Beta) With the Discord Custom Action, you can send messages to a specified channel (Each bot account uses a specific channel, so you can connect more accounts to send to different channels or servers.) In addition, you can choose a custom username and avatar image for the bot user. Slack (Beta) With the Slack Custom Action, you can easily use Slack's Webhook URLs to send messages to a channel.

With this, you can connect APIs that aren't compatible, convert a request to an email, and much more.","title":"Custom Actions"},{"location":"custom-actions.html#about-variables","text":"Variables are an important part of Custom Actions, and are characterized by a name surrounded by two dollar signs: $example$ . Variables can be used in any field that has a \u24e5 icon in the editor. They act as placeholders that are replaced by dynamic content as the request or email is received. Each request or email has a set of base variables that contain information like the request IP, method, headers, query string values, form values and the request content. To see a list of variables, click the Variables button in the editor. Clicking on a variable copies it to the clipboard. Almost all of the available Custom Actions can register a variable during the runtime of the actions, so for example you can register the result of a JSONPath query and use it in a \"Modify Response\" action to make the response dynamic, or even use it to send a request to another HTTP address, and then use the response of that. This works since Custom Actions are executed synchronously in a chain, sharing data as they're being executed.

Or looking for even more examples? Take a look at the WebhookScript example repository, and make a pull request if you want to contribute: https://github.com/fredsted/webhookscripts Validate request In this example, we use a common method of verifying webhooks by taking a hash of its contents concatenated to a secret. It demonstrates the way WebhookScript can get various information about the request by using the get_variable() function, as well as string concatenation, hashing, if statements and returning responses with content, status codes and headers using respond() , which halts execution. verification_secret = \"JHRlc3RTY3JpcHRTZWNyZXQ\" ; verification_challenge = var ( \"request.header.x-request-verification\" ); verification_result = hash_sha256 ( var ( 'request.content' ) + verification_secret ); if ( ! verification_challenge or verification_challenge != verification_result ) { respond ( \"Invalid request\" , 500 ); } headers = [ \"X-Success: Yes\" , \"X-Verification: \" + verification_challenge ]; respond ( \"Successful request\" , 200 , headers ); Send a x-www-form-urlencoded request content = query ([ 'country' : 'Cura\u00e7ao' , 'population' : 158665 ]) headers = [ 'Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' ]; response = request ( 'https://example.com' , content , 'POST' , headers ); Transform and resend In the following, an incoming request is JSON decoded to an array, transformed and sent to \"Web Service 1\". Then the output is saved and passed on to \"Web Service 2\" in XML format. Basic error handling and validation is demonstrated. // Configuration, fetched from the users' Global Variables ws1_api_key = var ( 'WS1_KEY' ) ws2_user_token = var ( 'WS1_USER_TOKEN' ) // Function for error handling function error ( message ) { echo ( 'Error: {}' . format ( message )) respond ( json_encode ([ 'error' : message ]), 500 ) } // Parse original request orig_req = json_decode ( var ( 'request.content' )) // If the JSON was invalid if ( ! orig_req ) { error ( 'Invalid request' ) } // Send request to Web Service 1, using format() for string placeholders ws1_url = 'https://ws1.example.com/3.0/lists/{}/interest-categories/{}/interests' . format ( list_id , group_id ) ws1_content = [ 'first_name' : orig_req [ 'firstName' ], 'last_name' : orig_req [ 'lastName' ] ] ws1_response = request ( ws1_url , json_encode ( ws1_content ), 'POST' , [ 'Authorization: Basic ' + ws1_api_key ] ) // Don't go further if the Web Service 1 step didn't succeed if ( ws1_response [ 'status' ] != 200 ) { echo ( ws1_response [ 'content' ]); // Log content to output error ( 'Invalid response from WS1' ) } // Get a value from the Web Service 1 request ws1_response_id = json_decode ( ws1_response )[ 'id' ] // Pass response on to Web Service 2 in XML format, using a multi-line string and format() ws2_content = ' <qdbapi> <usertoken>{}</usertoken> <listid>{}</listid> <field fid=\"7\">{}</field> </qdbapi>' . format ( ws2_user_token , orig_req [ 'listId' ], ws1_group_id ) ws2_response = request ( 'https://ws2.example.com/db/zzzzzz' , ws2_content , 'POST' , [ \"Action: API_EditRecord\" , \"Content-Type: application/xml\" ] ) if ( ws2_response [ 'status' ] != 200 ) { echo ( ws2_response [ 'content' ]); // Log content to debug log error ( 'Invalid response from WS2' ) } // Output the WS2 response content to debug output echo ( ws2_response [ 'content' ]) respond ( 'OK' , 200 ) Telegram bot The Messaging service Telegram allows bots using their API. The general principle is this: Create a Bot using the /newbot command sent to the BotFather Telegram User Using the bot token sent from BotFather , use the Telegram API to create a Webhook subscription (using your Webhook.site URL) Add some logic using WebhookScript! Note: Everywhere you see TELEGRAM_TOKEN , replace it with the token you got from BotFather! Subscribe to Webhook To create the Webhook subscription, change the token and the Webhook.site URL to your own and go to the following URL in your browser: https://api.telegram.org/bot TELEGRAM_TOKEN /setWebhook?url= https://webhook.site/a1351781 You should get a response similar to this: { \"ok\" : true , \"result\" : true , \"description\" : \"Webhook was set\" } First incoming Webhook When you add your bot to your Telegram contacts list, Telegram automatically sends a /start command to the bot, which triggers a Webhook similar to this: { \"update_id\" : 176446573 , \"message\" : { \"message_id\" : 1 , \"from\" : { \"id\" : 2346545645 , \"is_bot\" : false , \"first_name\" : \"Simon\" , \"language_code\" : \"en\" }, \"chat\" : { \"id\" : 34534673234 , \"first_name\" : \"Simon\" , \"type\" : \"private\" }, \"date\" : 1581706369 , \"text\" : \"/start\" , \"entities\" : [ { \"offset\" : 0 , \"length\" : 6 , \"type\" : \"bot_command\" } ] } } You should be able to see this in the Webhook.site requests list. From this, we have all the parts needed to build a script that answers to commands: // Telegram API token token = 'TELEGRAM_TOKEN' ; content = json_decode ( var ( '$request.content$' )); msg = content [ 'message' ][ 'text' ]; response = \"Couldn't come up with anything witty.\" ; if ( msg == \"How's it going?\" ) { response = 'Pretty good.' } if ( msg == \"How's the weather?\" ) { response = 'Raining.' } if ( msg == r \"You're (.*)\" ) { match = regex_extract_first ( r \"You're (.*)\" , msg ) response = 'No, YOU are {}' . format ( match ); } if ( msg == \"/start\" ) { response = \"Hi! I'm WebhookBot.\" } url = 'https://api.telegram.org/bot{}/sendMessage' . format ( token ) json = [ 'chat_id' : content [ 'message' ][ 'chat' ][ 'id' ], 'text' : response ]; request ( url , json_encode ( json ), 'POST' ); Things to note: The API token is added to the script, but could also have been saved in Global Variables in Control Panel and fetched out with the var() function. The third if-statement uses regex matching to provide a dynamic response. Someone typing \"You're a bot\" would receive \"No, YOU are a bot\" Finally, we JSON encode a WebhookScript array and send it using the request() function. Simply copy this script into a WebhookScript Custom Action (remember to change the token!), and click Save Action. Then, you can interact with the bot using the Telegram app: And that's it! Congratulations on your bot. It's not very smart, but from here, the possibilities are endless! Building HTML content The following script builds a piece of HTML content using the string_format function, based on previously defined variables, and shows how to use a function to return different content based on input. After this, it sends a JSON request (by converting an array to JSON via the json_encode function) containing the HTML using basic Bearer authentication. function alert_class () { if ( status == 'Operational' ) { return 'success' ; } if ( status == 'Degraded Performance' ) { return 'warning' ; } if ( string_contains ( status , 'Disruption' )) { return 'danger' ; } } template = ' <div class=\"alert alert-{}\"> <h2 class=\"alert-title\">{} - {}</h2> <p> {}<br /> State: {}<br /> Component affected: {} </p> <p>{}</p> </div>' ; postbody = string_format ( template , alert_class (), message , state , component , to_date ( 'now' ). date_format ( 'LLLL' ) ) json = [ 'alert' : [ 'title' : '{} - {}' . format ( component , state ), 'body' : postbody , 'draft' : false , 'types' : [ 'alert' ] ], ] request ( 'http://example.com/alerts' , json_encode ( json ), 'POST' , [ 'Content-Type: application/json' , 'Authorization: Basic {}' . format ( token ) ] ) Uploading and parsing CSV file With this script, a file upload form is displayed when visiting the URL. After submitting the form, the CSV file is processed and validated (in this example, there must be more than 2 rows). If it can't be validated, an error message is shown. Finally, the user is shown an \"Upload successful\" message if the CSV file is valid. url = var ( 'request.url' ) set_header ( 'content-type' , 'text/html' ); // Display file upload form and exit if HTTP method is not POST if ( var ( 'request.method' ) != 'POST' ) { respond ( ' <html> <head><title>Upload CSV</title></head> <body> <h1>Upload CSV</h1> <form action=\"{}\" method=\"POST\" enctype=\"multipart/form-data\"> <input type=\"file\" name=\"file\"/> <button type=\"submit\">Upload</button> </form> </body> </html> ' . format ( url )) } // Use a comma as delimiter and treat first row (0) as header row array = csv_to_array ( var ( 'request.file.file.content' ), ',' , 0 ) // If CSV can't be parsed, or there's less than 2 rows, fail if ( ! array or array . length () < 2 ) { respond ( ' <h1>Could not parse CSV</h1> <a href=\"{}\">Upload again</a> ' . format ( url )); } // Display the parsed CSV in JSON format respond ( ' <h1>Upload successful</h1> <pre>{}</pre> <p> <a href=\"{}\">Upload again</a> </p> ' . format ( json_encode ( array ), url ))","title":"Examples"},{"location":"webhookscript/examples.html#webhookscript-examples","text":"Info Do you have a nice example to share with other users?

Custom functions Define your own functions like this: function sub ( a , b ) { return a - b ; } Read more about functions in the reference . Debugging and output echo( string string) Adds string to script debug output. dd( any value) Stops Custom Action execution and adds value to script debug output. dump( any value) Adds value as a decoded string to script debug output. Custom Action Variables These functions lets you interface with other Custom Actions by getting and setting variables from them. These functions are also how you retrieve Global Variables defined in the Control Panel. var( string variable_name) : mixed Retrieves the value of a Variable or Global Variable (defined in the Control Panel). The surrounding dollar signs are not mandatory. Returns null if the variable does not exist. var ( 'request.header.x-request-verification' ) // returns value of the `x-request-verification` header set( string variable_name, string variable_value) Sets a Variable for usage in current action execution. The Variable is available to downstream actions, but not stored permanently. store( string global_variable_name, any value): any Permanently creates or updates a Global Variable (as defined in Control Panel.) The value can be retrieved with the var() function in subsequent action executions. variables : array A variable (not a function) containing an associative array with all available Webhook.site variables. user_agent = variables [ 'request.header.user-agent' ] HTTP query( array form_values) : string Converts an associative array into a form-style string, used for e.g. application/x-www-form-urlencoded requests or HTTP query strings. query ([ 'country' : 'Cura\u00e7ao' , 'population' : 158665 ]) // country=Cura%C3%A7ao&population=158665 request( string url, string content = '', string method = 'GET', array headers = []) : array Sends a HTTP request and returns an array with the following keys containing response data: content status headers url The headers should be an array of strings in the form of ['Header-Key-1: Foo', 'Header-Key-2: Bar'] . To get a JSON document, validate if valid JSON, and get a property: response = request ( 'https://example.com' ) decoded = json_decode ( response [ 'content' ]) if ( decoded ) { value = decoded [ 'value' ] } url_decode( string value) : string Returns an URL-decoded version of value . url_encode( string value) : string Returns an URL-encoded version of value . url_encode ( 'here\\'s a value' ) // here%27s+a+value Flow Control and Responses delay( int seconds, string code) Executes code in the future. Any output will be stored on the request and will show with a \"Was delayed\" label. The code will not inherit the execution scope. In this example, the format function is used to prepare the code string with a URL, causing {} to be replaced with with https://example.com . code = ' request( \"{}\", \\'{\"message\": \"Hello World!\"}\\', \"POST\" ) ' url = 'https://example.com' delay ( 5 , code . format ( url )); The maximum amount of seconds allowed is 604800 (7 days). exec( string code) : any Executes code in code and returns the result. The code will inherit the execution scope. import( string url) : any Downloads code located at url and returns the result. The code will inherit the execution scope.

Script execution continues. set_header( string header_name, string header_value) Sets or overwrites a response header of the URL. Script execution continues. set_response( string content, int status, array headers) Sets or overwrites response content, status and headers in single function. Script execution continues. headers should be an array of strings e.g. [\"X-Example: Value\", \"X-Foo: Bar\"] . set_status( number status) Sets or overwrites the HTTP response status of the current URL. Script execution continues. String base64_decode( string string) : string Returns a base64-encoded string. base64_encode( string string) : string Returns decoded base64 string. csv_to_array( string csvString, string delimiter, int headerOffset, string enclosure, string escape) : array Takes a CSV string and outputs to an array, with each row being an item in the array. Optionally, if headerOffset is delimiter will explicitly set the CSV delimiter the parser will attempt to use (e.g. ; ). Must be a single character. Defaults to , (comma.) headerOffset , when specified, causes the output array item's keys to be set to the header values.

Date Manipulation In WebhookScript, dates are not a specific type, and ar expressed in strings instead, which WebhookScript will attempt to parse. If possible, we recommend using a specific date format like ISO-8601 which leaves little doubt for misunderstanding. Date format characters WebhookScript uses the ISO format for converting and formatting dates, and the format is compatible with the Moment.js format method . The following examples are based on the date 2017-01-05 17:04:05.084512 .

utility functions and functions to interact with your Webhook.site URL. Syntax The language is built with a familiar PHP/JS/C-like syntax. Statements are separated using the ; character , but this is only required for multiple statements on the same line: Using semicolons (recommended) : js a = 1 + 2; b = a + 3; c = b - a; Using newlines: js a = 1 + 2 b = a + 3 c = b - a Data types The language has 6 data types: Bool Number String Regex Array Function Boolean Example usage: a = true ; b = 1 == 2 ; // false c = b == false ; // true d = c == \"hello\" ; // ERR: Cannot compare 'bool' and 'string' e = \"hello\" == r \"[0-9]\" ; // false f = \"hello\" == r \"l{2}\" ; // true Number Both integer and float values are supported. Example usage: a = 4 - 3 ; // 1 b = a / 3 ; // 0.333... String This data types represents a series of characters. Multi-byte characters (accents, diacritics) are treated properly. Example usage: a = \"hello\" ; b = \"w\u00f3\u00f3\u00f3rld!\" ; c = a + \" \" + b ; // \"hello w\u00f3\u00f3\u00f3rld!\" Regex Regex data type exists for advanced string matching. It is defined using the r\"...\" literal (a string literal prefixed with r ) and treated as PCRE (Perl-compatible) regular expressions (the same as within PHP itself) with Unicode mode enabled. Example usage: a = \"facebook\" ; b = r \"[o]{2}.*\" ; c = a == b ; // true Array Arrays are untyped (PHP-style) containers that can accomodate multiple values of different (or same) types. Optionally, array index can be defined for a value. By default, integer index starting from the lowest index found (or from 0 ) is used, but strings can also be used. Example usage: a = [ \"abc\" , 123 , 4 : true , false , r \"[A-Z]+\" ]; // Resulting array: [0: \"abc\", 1: 123, 4: true, 5: false, 6: r\"[A-Z]+\"] b = json_encode ([ \"the_number\" : 123 , \"other_numbers\" : [ 42 , 1337 , 80085 ]]) // Result: // { // \"the_number\": 123, // \"other_numbers\": [ // 42, // 1337, // 80085 // ] // } Ranges Simple way of defining ranges between numbers is provided via the a..[s..]b range syntax. a is the from value. b is the to value, inclusive, if it is not \"skipped\" due to a rather large step (see below). s (optionally) is the step value which to use. Example usage: a = 1..4 ; // (array) [0: 1, 1: 2, 4: 3, 5: 4] b = 1..2 . .4 ; // (array) [0: 1, 1: 3] c = 10..4 . .16 ; // (array) [0: 10, 1: 14] _x = 3 _y = 6 _z = 2 d = _x .. _z .. _y ; // (array) [0: 3, 1: 5] Return value of such \"range literal\" is a new array having values that are based on the range's parameters. Functions Function is a value type that represents a \"unit\" of some self-contained logic . In WebhookScript they have their own type and are treated as first-class citizens: they can be stored inside variables and passed around as such. Direct invocation of an anonymous function is supported, provided that the anonymous function's definition is enclosed in parentheses. A function does capture its surrounding variables. Example usage: // Traditional definition. function sub ( a , b ) { return a - b ; } // A variable \"sub\" that holds the \"sub()\" function is now defined in current scope. sub ( 1 , 2 ); // Returns -1 // Storing a function value into a variable. // Note: This is equivalent to the previous definition. sub_2 = function ( a , b ) { return a - b ; }; // A variable \"sub_2\" that holds the \"sub_2()\" function is now defined in current scope. sub_2 ( 1 , 2 ); // Returns -1 // Creating a function with alternative, short syntax. // Note: This is equivalent all of the previous definitions. sub_3 = ( a , b ) => { return a - b ; }; // A variable \"sub_3\" that holds the \"sub_3()\" function is now defined in current scope. sub_3 ( 1 , 2 ); // Returns -1 // Creating and using an anonymous function directly. // Using an alternative, short syntax. (( a , b ) => { return a - b ; })( 1 , 2 ); // Returns -1 Chained functions In addition to classical function invocation, WebhookScript additionaly supports Uniform Function Call Syntax (UFCS) as a way to call functions \"on values\". Essentially, it means that calling foo(bar); is equivalent to calling bar.foo() , or - to provide an example with additional parameters - that calling foo(bar, 1, true, \"something\"); is equivalent to calling bar.foo(1, true, \"something\") . Value-type based inference of called function name When using chained function invocation, the interpreter will try to find the most fitting function to call . \"Most fitting\" meaning that when the client calls bar() function on a value having the string type, WebhookScript will try to find and use the string_bar() first. If such function is not defined, only then will the interpreter use the original bar() function. Consider this a syntactic sugar to make coding in WebhookScript a bit more user-friendly. Because of this the user is able to call \"something\".length() on a string the same way as calling [1, 2, 3].length() on an array, even though there are in fact two separate functions string_length() and array_length() invoked behind the scenes. Operators Plethora of well known operators can be used to define relationships between and/or affect various values. Different operators can have various effects on various data types, some of which are covered down below. Precedence Precedence of various operators is defined as follows (from highest to lowest) : - ( ... ) (parentheses) - ! (logical not) - * , / (multiplication/division) - + , - (addition/subtraction) - == , != , >= , <= , > , < (comparison) - and (logical and) - or (logical not) - = (assignment) Precedence example Raw source Equivalent to 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 ((1 + 2) + 3) + 4 1 - 2 + 3 - 4 ((1 - 2) + 3) - 4 1 + 2 * 3 + 4 1 + (2 * 3) + 4 1 + 2 * 3 / 4 1 + ((2 * 3) / 4) 1 + -2 * 3 / 4 1 + (((-2) * 3) / 4) 1 and 2 or 3 and 4 (1 and 2) or (3 and 4) 1 or 2 or 3 and 4 (1 or 2) or (3 and 4) 1 or !2 or !3 and 4 (1 or (!2)) or ((!3) and 4)) x = true or false and true x = (true or (false and true)) x = a == b x = (a == b) x = a > 5 and b < 6 x = ((a > 5) and (b < 6)) Logical operators and Returns true if both operands are truthy . Otherwise returns false . or Returns true if either one (or both) operand is truthy . Otherwise returns false . Negation ! Negate the value located after this operator. Examples: js a = true; b = !a; // false c = !b; // true d = !!b; // false Assignment = Assigns some value to a variable. Can also be used to insert values to values that support it (eg. arrays). Examples: js a = 1; b = \"a word\"; c = false; d = r\"regul[ar]+\"; e = [\"x\", \"b\": \"z\"]; e[\"c\"] = \"x\"; // e == [\"x\", \"b\": \"z\", \"c\": \"x\"] Addition and multiplication + , - Performs addition (subtraction) of two values. Numbers: + Add two numbers. - Subtract two numbers. Strings: + Concatenate two strings. - Removes all occurences of the right side from the left side. - (if the right side is a Regex value) Removes all matches of the regex from the left side string. Examples: js a = 5 + 4 // (number) 9 b = 5 - 4; // (number) 1 c = \"a word and number \" + 5.to_string(); // (string) \"a word and number 5\" d = \"a word and number {}\".format(5); // (string) \"a word and number 5\" e = \"a word\" + \" and one more\"; // (string) \"a word and one more\" f = \"a word\" - \"or\"; // (string) \"a wd\" g = \"regular expressions\" - r\"regul[ar]+\\s*\"; // (string) \"expressions\" _x = 5 + \"4\" // ERR: Cannot use operator '+' with 'number' and 'string' _x = \"a word and number \" + 5; // ERR: Cannot use operator '+' with 'number' and 'string' * , / Performs multiplication (division) of two values. Numbers: + Multiply two numbers. - Divide two numbers. Examples: js a = 1 * -2; // (number) -2 b = 2 * 3; // (number) 6 c = 2 * \"3\"; // (string) \"33\" d = \"3\" * 4; // (string) \"3333\" e = 5 / 4; // (number) 1.25 g = 5 / 5; // (number) 1 _x = \"2\" * \"3\"; // ERR: Cannot use operator '*' with 'string' and 'string' _x = 5 / \"4\"; // ERR: Cannot use operator '/' with 'number' and 'string' _x = \"20\" / 4; // ERR: Cannot use operator '/' with 'string' and 'number' Control structures You can control the flow of your program with several kinds of statements the language provides. if construct The if construct - as in all other programming languages - allows you to dynamically branch your program flow based on some conditions during runtime. Examples a = true ; if ( a ) { b = 1 ; } // b == 1 c = false ; if ( c ) { d = 1 ; } else { d = 2 ; } // d == 2 a = false ; b = true ; c = 5 ; if ( a or b ) { d = 1 ; if ( d < c ) { e = d + c ; } } // d == 1, e == 6 for construct The for construct allows you to iterate over a value that supports it ( array or string values) , while performing a task on that collection's single item. Examples txt = \"123456789\" ; result = []; for ( n in txt ) { if ( 5 > n . to_number () > 0 ) { result . push ( n ); } } // result == [0: \"1\", 1: \"2\", 2: \"3\", 3: \"4\"] prices = [ 100 , 200 , 300 , 600 , 1200 ]; sentence_template = \"This costs {} units of money!\" ; results = []; for ( price in prices ) { results . push ( sentence_template . format ( price )); } // results == [ // 0: \"This costs 100 units of money!\", // 1: \"This costs 200 units of money!\", // 2: \"This costs 300 units of money!\", // 3: \"This costs 600 units of money!\", // 4: \"This costs 1200 units of money!\" // ] Note: The flow of program inside the for cycle can be controlled further by using the continue and break statements. while construct The while construct does a thing if a specified condition is met (if the condition expression has a truthy value). c = 0 ; while ( c < 100 ) { total = total + c ; c = c + 1 ; } // total == 4950 Note: The flow of program inside the while cycle can be controlled further by using the continue and break statements.","title":"Reference"},{"location":"webhookscript/reference.html#language-reference","text":"These are the functions that can be used in your script, and includes various utility functions and functions to interact with your Webhook.site URL.","title":"Language Reference"},{"location":"webhookscript/reference.html#syntax","text":"The language is built with a familiar PHP/JS/C-like syntax.
